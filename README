There's pretty much nothing here right now. But to (kinda) compile and run:

 - make

 - Adjust hm_rel-1.rel to correspond with your Erlang versions.
    - If you have done this, run 'erl -pa ./ebin' then on the Erlang
      command line:
         systools:make_script("hm_rel-1", [local]).
    - Quit the Erlang shell.

 - erl -boot hm_rel-1
